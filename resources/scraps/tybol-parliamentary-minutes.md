**Sir Elender, MP**: Thank you, Lord Speaker. Members of the House, Estateholders, Your Highness, 
In this land of ours there have always been the same people living from generation to generation, and they, by their courage and their virtues, have passed to us a free country. Our fathers deserve our praise. For to the inheritance they had received they added all the empire we have now, and it was not without blood and toil that they handed it down to us of the present generation. And then we ourselves, assembled here today, who are mostly in the prime of life, have, in most directions, added to the power of our empire and organized our state in such a way that it is perfectly well able to look after itself both in peace and in war.
