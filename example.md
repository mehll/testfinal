Taking care to make as little noise as possible, you make your way down to the foot of the stairwell. A hallway stretches before you. It's dark (not as bad for you) and musty. That sickly iron smell you'd whiffed above hangs even thicker here -- you're sure now that it's blood. You can see the corridor curve off to the right perhaps thirty feet down and there's a heavy wooden door to your left about ten feet away. 

***

I approach the wooden door.

***

You reach out your foot to take a step, and pause -- you'd nearly missed the pressure plate right before you. A cursory glance at the wall reveals two narrow slits -- one more step and you're certain they would have skewered you. Slinking past you sidle up beside the wooden door. Another pressure plate lies just in front of it.

***

I examine the door, looking for a way to open it. I avoid touching the door.

*** 

The door has no keyhole or handle. There is a small open eyeslit in the door about a foot above your head. As far as you can tell just by looking (and sniffing), it would open if you pushed it.

***

I push open the door.

***

The door does not give. The door feels like it's blocked, or barred, on the other side.

*** 

I pull out some rope, and using my Any-Tool I fashion a makeshift fishing hook. I cast the hook through the eyeslit, fishing for the bottom of the plank barring the door.

***

Guided by your intuition you visualize the hook being lowered down to where the bar probably is. You bob it around...  and around... until you feel it latch onto something thick. The bar was just the size you'd imagined -- and with a heave you're able to move it. A few more minutes and you hear it clatter loudly to the floor, breaking the silence you'd forgotten you were in. 

***

I almost gasp but cover my mouth. I quickly pull up my hook, wait, and listen.

***

You put your ear right up to the door. You don't seem to hear anything inside...

***

I slowly push open the door and peek inside.

***

You see a small, dank room, a narrow grate near the top giving a paltry amount of light. The bar you'd dislodged lies on the floor, and beside it, a human skeleton wearing tattered rags. Suddenly you hear a low rumbling below you -- it was a deep noise, but it almost sounded like a roar.
